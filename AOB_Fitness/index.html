                <h2>OBF Coaching Philosophy</h2>
				<p>
					I believe that as a coach you have a unique opportunity to empower and make a real difference with the people you serve.
I am a values based coach, I live and coach through the values of honesty, respect, positivity , self-development and trust.
I believe as coaches, we have a unique chance to help people get in touch with their core values. When they gain that clarity and sense of purpose, seemingly everything becomes easier, making decisions, choosing next steps, recognizing sooner when they’re off-track.
The confidence and fulfilment that comes with living and working in alignment with their values allows them to flourish with meaning and purpose. 
I believe in creating an environment that encourages people to learn and develop in and out of the gym, through good and bad times. 
Values and teamwork underpin my philosophy by creating a values driven culture that empowers people to lead thus creating a duel management structure. 
Reflection is at the core of my philosophy in an open environment that allows both clients and coaches to evolve.

					We take a bottoms up, holistic approach to development. Mind-set and wellness underpin our philosophy and act as a starting point from which we work from.

Creating your life script, establishing “who” you want to become and “what” life you want to create is all part of our Project Me  mind-set program. 
To complement this the OBF principles of wellness will help you lay the foundation of the person you want to become.

Movement Quality processed movement quantity, and we develop the four movement pillars of mobility, skill, work capacity and strength which synergistically help you to create the physical capacity you desire.

Community encapsulates all of the above as we believe that people become a product of their environments. Creating awareness around what role people play in your life will allow you chose who you want to influence your future.

                <p>I believe the first role of a coach is to foster self belief and confidence in those he/she works with. This self belief and confidence will act as a catalysis to unlocking new levels of commitment.

I believe your training should be a ongoing study of movement , no different that the study of the clarinet, the piano or any other skill set. Each rep of every set should be journey in the ongoing pursuit of mastery in the movement you are performing.

I believe in encouraging health before fitness and performance. Challenge the industry norm of instant fat loss and results. People judge the effectiveness of their training by its ability to produce fatigue and sweat.

I believe in building people up NOT constantly breaking them down.

Challenge your perception of exercise : “change – I ran today to burn off the take away I ate last night, to – I ran today to strengthen my heart and lungs”

I believe that you change by reflecting the community around you therefore being part of a group of like minded people is a key ingredient for growth.

Get addicted to the drug of being better than yesterday !!
